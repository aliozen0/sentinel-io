  - task_id: task_monitor_logs
    name: Monitor Logs
    objective: Detect anomalies in the stream.
    agents:
      - name: watchdog_agent
        instructions: You are a Monitoring Expert. Analyze the input logs. Look for latency > 0.5s or temperature > 80C. If found, output "ANOMALY_DETECTED" and the Node ID.
